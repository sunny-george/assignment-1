    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>
      George Sunny is a curious and driven creative based in Port Harcourt, Nigeria,
      with a background in civil engineering and a growing passion for tech. After
      getting his hands dirty on major construction sites—literally—he began discovering
      the exciting world of DevOps and cloud engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      What started as an interest in writing command-line code soon became something deeper.
      George found joy in the logic, structure, and problem-solving that tech offers.
      These days, you'll often find him tinkering in the terminal, learning automation tools,
      or exploring how to build systems that just work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of tech, George is all about balance. He's a big fan of music, movies, and
      any story that can stir the soul or spark a good conversation. He brings that same
      energy—thoughtful, creative, and a bit playful—into everything he does.
      He's not just building a career; he's building a life that blends discipline, passion,
      and curiosity. And he's just getting started.
